# Multidimension-constrained suspect screening

## Overview: 
This GitHub repository contains suspect lists, R scripts, and demo data associated with the article:
"Multidimensional-constrained Suspect Screening of Hydrophobic Chemicals Using Gas Chromatography-Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization-Ion Mobility Spectrometry" by Xiaodi Shi, Anna Sobek, and Jonathan P. Benskin.
In this study, gas chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-ion mobility-high resolution mass spectrometry (GC-APCI-IM-HRMS) was employed to develop a suspect screening workflow constrained by exact mass, retention time (RT), collision cross section (CCS), and product ion data, alongside a continuous scoring system, to reduce false positives and improve identification confidence.
