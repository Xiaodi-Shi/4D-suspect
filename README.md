# Multidimension-constrained suspect screening

## Overview: 
This GitHub repository contains suspect lists, R scripts, and demo data associated with the article:

"Multidimensional-constrained Suspect Screening of Hydrophobic Chemicals Using Gas Chromatography-Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization-Ion Mobility Spectrometry" by Xiaodi Shi, Anna Sobek, and Jonathan P. Benskin.

In this study, gas chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-ion mobility-high resolution mass spectrometry (GC-APCI-IM-HRMS) was employed to develop a suspect screening workflow constrained by exact mass, retention time (RT), collision cross section (CCS), and product ion data, alongside a continuous scoring system, to reduce false positives and improve identification confidence.

## Suspect lists: 

We compiled two suspect lists containing information on identity, exact mass, CCS, and RT.

**-GCwCCS:** This list was derived from matching contaminants from all GC-based suspect lists in the NORMAN-SLE with experimentally-derived CCS values from a unified database of 23 scientific articles published between 2016 and 2022, resulting in 1,060 compounds.
